Hey there! ✨ Nice to meet you! I'm a _Data Analyst & Marketing Strategist_ who thrives on turning raw data into compelling stories and actionable insights. I recently graduated with an **MS in Business Analytics** from Northeastern University, Boston, and have 5+ years of experience working with data, visualization, and analytics in the Fintech space.

I’m obsessed with solving business problems using data—whether it’s optimizing marketing strategies, analyzing customer behavior, or finding hidden trends that drive growth. I love diving deep into **SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI**, and other analytics tools to make sense of complex datasets and help businesses make smarter decisions. Oh, and I firmly believe that **a great dashboard is worth a thousand spreadsheets! 📊✨**

Beyond the data world, you’ll probably find me hunting down the best coffee shops, experimenting with new recipes, or planning my next food adventure. I also have a soft spot for **stand-up comedy, basketball 🏀, and a good Netflix binge**.

Let’s connect—I’d love to chat about data, strategy, or just the best ramen spots in town! 🍜🚀
