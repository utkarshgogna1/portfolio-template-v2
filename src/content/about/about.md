Hi there! I'm Utkarsh Gogna —a passionate computer science enthusiast based in Boston, MA 🎓. Currently, I'm pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Science** at Northeastern University, where I dive deep into **machine learning, natural language processing, and full-stack development**. I thrive on transforming complex problems into innovative, real-world solutions 🤖🚀.

With hands-on experience ranging from **AI-enhanced cybersecurity to developing interactive chatbots**, I've built a solid foundation in multiple programming languages and cutting-edge technologies. Whether mentoring students as a Teaching Assistant or collaborating with industry leaders, I love sharing knowledge and learning something new every day 💻📚.

When I'm not coding or exploring the latest tech trends,  
 you’ll probably find me tinkering with new ideas or simply enjoying a good challenge , hunting down the best coffee shops, experimenting with new recipes, or planning my next food adventure. I also have a soft spot for **stand-up comedy, basketball 🏀, and a good Netflix binge**.

Welcome to my portfolio—let’s connect and create something amazing together! 🤝✨
