        "description": "This project implements a pipeline for processing long-form audio and integrating multiple NLP tasks, including speech-to-text transcription using OpenAI's Whisper, text summarization with Facebook's BART, and text classification. The system also performs named entity recognition using a custom LSTM-CRF model, with detailed evaluations on transcription accuracy and summarization quality.",
